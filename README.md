Prerequisits:
- You will need npm
- You *might* need some sort of web server (I use http-server)

Installing:
`npm i`

Building:
`npm run build`

For development:
`npm run watch`

To Run:
- Open `index.html` in a browser
- If that doesn't work, run your web server and serve the `index.html` file
- `sudo http-server -p 9000` then navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`
